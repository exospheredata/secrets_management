## Cookbook Testing

### Before you begin
Setup your testing and ensure all dependencies are installed.  Open a terminal windows and execute:

```ruby
gem install bundler
bundle install
berks install
```

### Data_bags for Test-Kitchen

This cookbook requires the use of a data_bag for setting certain values.  Local JSON version need to be stored in the directory structure as indicated below:

```
├── chef-repo/
│   ├── cookbooks
│   │   ├── secrets_management
│   │   │   ├── .kitchen.yml
│   ├── data_bags
│   │   ├── data_bag_name
│   │   │   ├── data_bag_item.json

```

**Note**: Storing local testing versions of the data_bags at the root of your repo is considered best practice.  This ensures that you only need to maintain a single copy while protecting the cookbook from being accientally committed with the data_bag.  However, if you must change this location, then update the following key in the .kitchen.yml file.  

```
data_bags_path: "../../data_bags/"
```

### Rakefile and Tasks

### Chefspec and Test-Kitchen

1. `bundle install`: Installs and pulls all ruby gems dependencies from the Gemfile.

2. `berks install`: Installs all cookbook dependencies based on the [Berksfile](Berksfile) and the [metadata.rb](metadata.rb)

3. `rake`: This will run all of the local tests - syntax, lint, unit, and maintainers file.
